Course: MATH211 – Multivariable Calculus \& Linear Algebra



Project Overview

This project explores the application of Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus in Digital Image Processing using Python.  
We used concepts like matrices, kernels, convolution, partial derivatives, gradient vectors, and edge detection to manipulate and analyze images.



Tools and Libraries Used

* Python 3.12
* NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2)
* Matplotlib
* PIL (Pillow)
* SciPy

        What’s Included in the Notebook
- Task 1: Environment Setup
- Task 2: Image Loading and Preprocessing
- Task 3: Manual Convolution with Various Kernels
- Task 4: Edge Detection Using Sobel and Gradient Magnitudes
- Task 5: RGB Channel Processing with Edge Detection
- Task 6: Creativity – Feature Extraction, Compression Simulation, Comparison with SciPy

         How to Run It
1. Open the .ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure all images are in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.
4. Results will be displayed as visual outputs (images, plots).
